# fig 1
# in figure 1 we want to have the empty map with 20 obstacles and vel of 0.2
# The script will generate a "empty_obs20_vel02_testplot1.pdf" file inside plots/
# We can include any amount of plots to this figure by adding them to "planner"
# In figure 1 we want to compare three wpg's for the cadrl model
